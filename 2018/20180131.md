As programmers, we tell each other that simplicity is achievable.
And I have worked with a few programmers who do achieve simplicity.
But their simple code is not always tweetable; it is not always summarized by a 
few paragraphs of blog post; it is not always understood in an instant.
Their code is simple because it tolerates change.
A domain model is revised, protocols rise and fall, someone has a feature 
request.
Code that feels simple to me is code that leaves a little space for these and 
other unknown futures.
And that space seems to come from understanding that different things are 
different and should be treated differently.
Lines drawn along those differences are the seams in the sidewalk that permit 
the concrete to expand and contract.
What I like about the state machine is that it provides these lines instead of 
prescribing code.
The guidelines still apply even when the code changes.
This does not exclude the possibility that some things are the same, that some
abstractions are correct.
But maybe it does mean that the tidiest abstractions warrant the most doubt.
