## Haskell and types

### Polymorphism

Parametric polymorphism: `f :: a -> b -> a`

- A function is parametrically polymorphic when it can take any type.
- _parametricity_: behavior of a function with respect to the types of its 
  arguments is uniform. Does not behave differently depending on the type of the
  argument.

Constrained polymorphism: `f :: (Eq a, Ord b) => a -> b -> a`

- The type of the argument must be an instance of the specified type.
- The polymorphism of `a` is _constrained_ to the typeclass of `Eq`.

Polymorphic constant: a literal value that could be one of several types, e.g.
`(-1)`.
The compiler treats this as `Num a` until it is forced to a resolve it to a 
concrete type like `Int`.
The Damas-Hindley-Milner type system always infers the most general type 
possible.

Typeclass syntax:

```haskell
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool

data Foo = Foo

instance Eq Foo where
    -- as infix
    Foo == Foo = True
    -- or as prefix
    (==) Foo Foo = True
```
