`Monoid` is "Appendable".

`Functor` is "Mappable".

`Applicative` is "Callable"?

## Chapter 16, Applicatives

`pure` lifts a value into an Applicative.

`<*>` is `ap`.

### Applicative functors are monoidal functors

```haskell
-- function application
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b

-- fmap
(<$>) :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- ap
(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

`ap` is monoidal because it appends (`mappend`) two values of one type to create
one value of the same type.

```haskell
[(+ 1), (+ 2)] <*> [1, 2]
-- [2, 3, 3, 4]
```

The monoid in tuple.

```haskell
instance Monoid a => Applicative ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
```

```haskell
("foo", (+ 1)) <*> ("bar", 1)
-- ("foobar", 2)
```

 `<*>` produces a new `b` by applying (+ 1) to 1 to get 2.
An instance of Applicative is needed for `a` because there is no function
provided to do that.
Instead, mappend is called on `"foo"` and `"bar"`.
