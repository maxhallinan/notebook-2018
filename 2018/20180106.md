## Detecting HTML links

Solution to [this](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/detect-html-links/problem)
HackerRank problem: given lines of HTML, find the anchor tag urls and the text
for the anchor tag, and format them as lines of `URL,TEXT`.

This takes a filename argument:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
paste -d, \
<(cat $1 | \
grep -o '<a.*>.*</a>' | \
grep -oP '(?<=href=)[^> ]*' | \
sed 's/"//g') \
<(cat $1 | \
grep -o '<a.*>.*</a>' | \
grep -o '>[^<].*[^>]<' | \
grep -o '[^>].*[^<]' | \
sed 's/<.*>//g')
```

This works but I wonder if there's a better and easier way. Maybe using Awk.

Things I learned:

- `<()`: process substitution
- `paste` can be used to merge a file linewise
- `grep -o` returns the 

### Process substitution

The pipe operator connects the stdout of the left command to the stdin of the
right command. 
This only works when connecting two commands.

```bash
echo 'foo' | grep -o 'f'
f
```

Process substitution enables you to substitute one or more command pipelines for
input and output files.

- `<(COMMAND LIST)`: substitute for input file
- `>(COMMAND LIST)`: substitute for output file

More than one substitution can be used for a given command:

```bash
cat <(echo 'foo' | grep -o 'f') <(echo 'bar' | grep -o 'b')
f
b
```

## Formatting markdown

This is a work in progress.

The idea is to have a script that formats a Markdown file.

- Maximum line length is 80 characters, except when the line contains an anchor 
tag.
- Sentences start on a new line.
- Everything else is preserved.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fmtmd
cat $1 |
join |
sed -r 's/(\.|\?) /\1\n/g' |
fold -s 
```

## Questions and Next steps

- What's the difference between `paste` and `join`.
- Learn more about `sed`, `awk`.
- Revise my HackerRank problem solution with `sed` and `awk`.
- Finish `fmtmd`.
- Write a blog post about process substitution.
