## grep

`-w`

The `-w, --word-regexp` option enables you to search for words matching the 
pattern.
As if the pattern is surrounded by `[[:<:]]'` and `[[:>:]]'`.

What are the patterns `[[:<:]]` and `[[:>:]]`?

`-i`

Ignore case.

`-v`

Only print lines that do not match the pattern.

## sed

The character after the command is the delimiter character.

`&` is the matched string. This symbol can be used in the replacement string.

Wrap `foo` pattern in parentheses.

```bash
echo 'foo' | sed /foo/(&)/

```
