## stack troubleshooting

Had trouble with `stack build` and `stack init`.

Reinstalled stack.

Followed the [stack documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#start-your-new-project).

Ran

```bash
stack new foo
cd foo
stack setup
stack build
```

Issues

- Installing stack and `stack setup` took a long time to download the dependencies.
  This issue is documented [here](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2240).
- `stack build` did not work the first time. I had to run `stack init` and then 
  `stack build`.

## Exposing modules

In the .cabal file, there is a section called `library`.

`library` has a section called `exposed-modules`. 

This is a list of the _module names_ (not filenames) of the exposed modules.

The module name and the file name must match.

When a module is added to that list, that module should automatically be loaded
into a repl session when running `stack ghci`.

## Using QuickCheck and checkers

Haskell testing libraries

- `hspec` is a unit testing library
- `QuickCheck` is a property testing library
- `checkers` is a library of QuickCheck properties for standard typeclasess 

Add `QuickCheck` and `checkers` to `build-depends` in .cabal file.

Run `stack build` or `stack ghci` to install.

```haskell
import qualified Test.Hspec
import qualified Test.QuickCheck

runTests :: IO ()
runTests = Test.Hspec.hspec $ do
  Test.Hspec.describe "A sample property test" $ do
    Test.Hspec.it "1 + n should always be greater than 1" $ do
      -- takes a function that returns a boolean
      Test.QuickCheck.property $ \x -> x + 1 > (x :: Int)
```

### QuickCheck types

QuickCheck depends on two types to generate random data:

- `Arbitrary` typeclass
- `Gen` newtype

QuickCheck also exposes a value `arbitrary`.
`arbitrary` is used to generate random values of a certain type.
This works by asserting the type of `arbitrary`.
By the type of `arbitrary`, Haskell knows which instance `Arbitrary` to dispatch
to.

The `Arbitrary` instance for a type is not the exclusive way to generate a 
random value of that type.
`Arbitrary` is used for dynamic dispatch, when a generator is not explicitly 
provided.
But you can explicitly provide a generator and not have QuickCheck dispatch to 
the generator associated with the `Arbitrary` instance.

```haskell
arbitrary :: Arbitrary a => Gen a
```

#### How to create a generator for a type

Generate one value:

```haskell
-- Gen is a monad
-- this puts `1` into the Gen monad
-- will always generate `1`
alwaysOne :: Gen Int
alwaysOne = return 1
```

Generate one of two values:

```haskell
oneBool :: Gen Bool
oneBool = Test.QuickCheck.choose (True, False)
```

Generate one of many values:

```haskell
oneOfThree :: Gen Int
oneOfThree = Test.QuickCheck.elements [1,2,3]
```

Polymorphic generators:

```haskell
gen2Tuple :: (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b) => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (a, b)
gen2Tuple = do
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  b <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  return (a, b)

-- Can use the same generator to produce different types of tupels
Test.QuickCheck.sample (gen2Tuple :: Gen (String, Int))
Test.QuickCheck.sample (gen2Tuple :: Gen (Bool, String))
```

```haskell
gen2Tuple :: (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary c) => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (a, b, c)
gen3Tuple = do
  -- `arbitrary` is an alias for a generic `Arbitrary a => Gen a`
  -- when the concrete type of `gen3Tuple` is asserted, then the `Arbitrary`
  -- instance for that type is used to generate the random value
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  b <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  c <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  return (a, b, c)

-- Can use the same generator to produce different types of tupels
Test.QuickCheck.sample (gen3Tuple :: Gen (String, Int, Bool))
Test.QuickCheck.sample (gen3Tuple :: Gen (Int, Bool, Bool))
```

Control the frequency of how often a specific value is generated:

```haskell
maybeGen :: Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (Maybe a)
maybeGen = do
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  -- now `Just a` is three times as likely to be generated as `Nothing`
  Test.QuickCheck.frequency [ (1, return Nothing)
                            , (3, return Just a)
                            ]
```

#### How to see sample values produced by the generator

```haskell
-- prints sample values one to a line
-- Test.QuickCheck.sample :: Show a => Gen a -> IO ()
Test.QuickCheck.sample (Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary :: Gen Int)

-- returns a list of sample values
-- Test.QuickCheck.sample' :: Gen a -> IO [a]
Test.QuickCheck.sample' (Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary :: Gen Int)
```
Why is the IO required?

- The functions use a global source of random values.

#### QuickCheck without hspec

Here, the property function can be written without specifying the generator.
`quickCheck` will automatically generate the needed arguments.

```haskell
import Test.QuickCheck

prop_addition :: Int -> Bool
prop_addition x = x + 1 > 1

prop_subtraction :: Int -> Int -> Bool
prop_subtraction x y = x - y < x

runTests :: IO ()
runTests = Test.QuickCheck.quickCheck prop_addition
```

### Custom Arbitrary instances

There are two steps to writing an `Arbitrary` instance.

1. Write a generator for the type
2. Assign that generator to the `arbitrary` operation of the instance.

```haskell
data Foo = Foo deriving (Eq, Show)

fooGen :: Gen Foo
fooGen = return Foo

instance Arbitrary Foo where
  arbitrary = fooGen
```

Instance polymorphic higher-kinded type

```haskell
data Bar a = Bar a deriving (Eq, Show)

barGen :: Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (Bar a)
barGen = do
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  return (Bar a)

instance Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a => Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary (Bar a) where
  arbitrary = barGen

sample $ (abritrary :: Test.QuickCheck.Gen (Bar String))
```

Instance for polymorphic higher-kinded product type

```haskell
data Baz a b = Baz a b deriving (Eq, Show)

bazGen :: (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b) => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (Baz a b)
bazGen = do
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  b <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  return (Baz a b)

instance (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b) => Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary (Baz a b) where
  arbitrary = bazGen

sample $ (arbitrary :: Test.QuickCheck.gen (Baz String Int))
```

Instance for a sum type:

```haskell
import qualified Test.QuickCheck
import qualified Test.QuickCheck.Gen

data Sum a b = Foo a | Bar b deriving (Eq, Show)

sumGen :: (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b) => Test.QuickCheck.Gen (Sum a b)
sumGen = do
  a <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  b <- Test.QuickCheck.arbitrary
  -- will randomly construct either `Foo a` or `Bar b`
  Test.QuickCheck.Gen.oneof [ return $ Foo a
                            , return $ Bar b ]

instance (Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary a, Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary b) => Arbitrary a b where
  arbitrary = sumGen
```

### Generate functions of a particular type

`QuickCheck` exposes a second typeclass called `CoArbitrary`.
`CoArbitrary` has a method `coarbitrary`: 

```haskell
coarbitrary :: CoArbitrary a => a -> Gen a -> Gen b
```

Any type with a `Generic` instance gets a `CoArbitrary` instance for free.

```haskell
data Foo = Bar | Baz deriving (Generic)

instance CoArbitrary Foo
```

> ...CoArbitrary covers the function input type whereas the (related) Arbitrary 
> class is used for the function result type.
> &ndash The Haskell Book, page 661


#### Fun type

`Fun a b` represents a function `a -> b`.

```haskell
data Fun a b = 
  Fun (a Test.QuickCheck.Function.:-> b, b, Test.QuickCheck.Function.Shrunk) 
      (a -> b)
```

The data constructor `Fun` takes two arguments.
The first argument is a data-type representation of the randomly generated 
function.
The second argument is a randomly generated, callable function of the type 
`a -> b`.

### Follow-up Questions

1. What is the Generic typeclass?
2. What are some examples of using `CoArbitrary`?
3. How is QuickCheck able to randomly generate functions?

### Using Checkers

`checkers` is a library of QuickCheck helpers.
These helpers include properties for testing standard typeclasses, e.g Functor 
and Applicative.

Steps to test if an instance of a typeclass follows the laws for that typeclass:

1. import `Data.QuickCheck.Checkers`
1. import `Data.QuickCheck.Classes`
1. make sure the type has `Arbitrary` instances 
1. make an instance of `Data.QuickCheck.Checkers.EqProp` for the type

```haskell
import qualified Test.QuickCheck as QuickCheck
import qualified Test.QuickCheck.Checkers as Checkers
import qualified Test.QuickCheck.Classes as Classes

-- define the type and the typeclass instances

data Foo = Bar | Baz deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Semigroup Foo where
  (<>) Bar Bar = Bar
  (<>) Baz Baz = Baz
  (<>) Bar x   = x
  (<>) x Bar   = x

instance Monoid Foo where
  mempty = Bar

-- create an instance of Arbitrary for the type

instance QuickCheck.Arbitrary Foo where
  arbitrary = QuickCheck.frequency [ (1, Bar), (2, Baz) ]

-- create an instance of EqProp for the type

instance Checkers.EqProp Foo where
  -- any type with an instance of Eq can use Checkers.eq
  (=-=) = Checkers.eq

-- test if Foo is a law-abiding Monoid instance

runTests :: IO ()
runTests = Checkers.quickBatch (Classes.monoid Bar)
```
