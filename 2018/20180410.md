## Activity Streams

### Model

All JSON documents are either an Object or a Link.
All other types are derived from these two types.
The core types include:

- Object
- Link
- Activity: a subtype of Object that describes some form of action that may 
  happen.
- IntransitiveActivity
- Collection
- OrderedCollection
- CollectionPage
- OrderedCollectionPage

An object is a link when:

- `"type": "Link"`
- any of the types in the value of the type property are extensions of the Link
  type.

## Object

Primary base type for Activity Streams vocabulary.

All instances of Object have a common set of properties, including:

- `attachment`
- `attributedTo`
- `audience`
- `content`
- `context`
- `contentMap`
- `name`
- `nameMap`
- `endTime`
- `generator`
- `icon`
- `image`
- `inReplyTo`
- `location`
- `preview`
- `published`
- `replies`
- `startTime`
- `summary`
- `summaryMap`
- `tag`
- `updated`


_All properties are optional, including `id` and `type`_
