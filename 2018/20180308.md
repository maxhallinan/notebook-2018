## Postgres and Python

[psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html) is the most popular Python
Postgres driver.

The basic workflow is:

- Create a connection to the database.
- Create a cursor on that connection.
- Execute a query.
- Commit the changes to the database.
- Close the cursor.
- Close the connection.

```python
import psycopg2

connection = psycopg2.connect("dbname=<database name>")
cursor = connection.cursor()

query = """
SELECT %s FROM %s
"""

values = ("<column name>", "<table name")

cursor.execute(query, values)

connection.commit()

cursor.close()
connection.close()
```

Queries are strings that get interpolated with values.
Psycopg converts Python values to SQL values by using the type.
Do not have to use the different interpolation variables in the query string,
just `%s`.
Named arguments are also supported. This makes it easier to use the same value
in multiple places within the query string:

```python
query = """
SELECT %(foo)s FROM %(foo)s
"""

values = { 'foo': 'bar' }

cursor.execute(query, values)
```
