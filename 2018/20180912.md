Little language idea:

A microworld for typeclasses.
And really, it's not about typeclasses exactly.
It's about the idea that there's:
  - types of data
  - sets of operations that can be performed on each type of data
This division, this ontology is the focus.
You create the groupings of values and the groupings of operations, then you 
combine a grouping of values into a grouping of operations in order to use the 
operation on the value.
What's the outcome?
Like, when you use this language, what does it do?
What's the equivalent of driving the Turtle around?

```
monster Troll = Big | Small | Round

spellbook Levitate has spells
  levitate :: a -> Bool

spells for Troll in Levitate
```
