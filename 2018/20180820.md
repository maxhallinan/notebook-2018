## GraphQl

### Directives

Add logic to queries.

Dynamically change the shape and structure of a query.

```graphql
query Hero($withFriends: Boolean!) {
  hero {
    friends @include(if: $withFriends) {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

There are two directives:

- `@include(if: Boolean)`: only include the field if the boolean is true
- `@skip(if: Boolean)`: skip this field if the boolean is true

### Mutations

Mutations are a type of query used to write data.

```graphql
# pass in the name string
mutation CreateFoo($name: String) {
  # create the Foo with a name
  createFoo(name: $name) {
    # return the name of the created foo in the response
    name
  }
}
```

Query fields run _in parallel_.
Mutation fields run _in series_.
A query that includes two mutations will not create a race condition.

### Inline Fragments

Some fields have union or interface types.
When querying that field, you must use an "inline fragment" to access the data
on that field.

```graphql
query HeroForEpisode($episode: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $episode) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

This is a way of implementing polymorphic fields.

### Meta fields

When requesting polymorphic fields, you can request the `__typename` field to
know which type it is.

## Schema and Types

> Every GraphQL service defines a set of types which completely describe the
> set of possible data you can query on that service.

### Type system

**Object types**

Represents a type of object that exists in the service and fields on that
object.

```
type Character {
  name: String!
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
}
```

`String` is a built-in scalar type.

`!` means that the field is non-nullable.

`[Episode]!` is a non-nullable array of `Episode` objects.

**Arguments**

Every field can have zero or more objects.

**Scalar types**

Scalar types represent concrete, unstructured data.

The query is a tree structure.
Scalar types are leaves on that tree.

Default scalar types are:

- Int
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- ID

Custom scalar types can be defined.

**Enumeration types**

A special scalar type that is restricted to a set of values.

```
enum Foo {
  FOO
  BAR
  BAZ
}
```

A field with type `Foo` must have a value `FOO`, `BAR`, or `BAZ`.

Two types of polymorphism:

- parametric polymorphism: `a -> a`
  - unconstrained
  - uses type variables
  - concrete types do not matter
- constrained polymorphism: `Num a => a -> a` 
  - puts typeclass constraints on the type variables
  - limits the set of potential types that the type variable can resolve to
- parametricity: the behavior of the function with respect to the types of its
  inputs is uniform.

> Typeclasses and types in Haskell are, in a sense, opposites. Where a
> declaration of a type defines how that type in particular is created,
> a declaration of a typeclass defines how a set of types are consumed
> or used in computations.

- page 195

Common typeclasses

- `Bounded`: for types that have an upper and lower bound
- `Enum`: for types that can be enumerated
- `Eq`: for types that can be tested for equality
- `Ord`: for types that have a sequential order
- `Show`: for types that have a string representation

Defining the `Eq` typeclass

```haskell
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

Writing a typeclass instance

```haskell
data Trivial = Trivial'

instance Eq Trivial where
  Trivial' == Trivial' = True
```

partial function: a function that does not handle all possible inputs

Typeclass with type parameter

```haskell
data Foo a = Foo a

instance Eq a => Eq (Foo a) where
  (==) (Foo x1) (Foo x2) = x1 == x2
```

The `Real` typeclass requires an instance of `Num`.
`Real` cannot override the methods of `Num`.
`Real` can only add to the methods of `Num`.

Summary

- Types describe what the data is.
- Typeclasses describe how the data is consumed.
- A type has an instances of a typeclass.
- An instance of a typeclass defines how the methods of the typeclass operate on
  a value of the type.
- Parametric polymorphism is the use of unconstrained type variables.
- Parametricity refers to functions whose behavior is uniform without regard to
  the type of its arguments.
- Constrained (ad-hoc) polymorphism is the use of typeclasses to make 
  requirements about a value.
- Constrained polymorphism narrows the possible concrete types of a value from
  anything to a set of types.
- Concrete types are monomorphic.
