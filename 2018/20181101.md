## Haskell parser combinators

### The trifecta library

```haskell
import Text.Trifecta

-- parseString :: Parser a -> Text.Trifecta.Delta.Delta -> String -> Text.Trifecta.Result a

parseString (char 'a') mempty "a"
-- Success 'a'
```

`Text.Trifecta.Delta.Delta`

This type "keeps track of the cursor position of the parser".
The cursor position is referred to in error messages.

`Delta` is a union of: 

- `Columns !Int64 !Int64`:
  - number of characters
  - number of bytes
- `Tabs !Int64 !Int64 !Int64`: 
  - characters before the tab 
  - characters after the tab 
  - number of bytes
- `Lines !Int64 !Int64 !Int64 !Int64`: 
  - newlines 
  - characters since last newline 
  - bytes 
  - bytes since last newline
- `Directed !ByteString !Int64 !Int64 !Int64 !Int64`: 
  - current filename 
  - lines since last line directive
  - characters since last newline
  - bytes
  - bytes since last newline

`Text.Trifecta.Delta.Delta` has an instance of Monoid.
`mempty` is the empty Delta.
`mempty` is `Columns 0 0`.

Sequencing char parsers will only return the last char parsed: 
`char 'a' >> char 'b'` is `Success 'b'`.

`string` accumulates the parsed chars: `string "ab"` is `Success "ab"`.

That makes sense because `Parser Char` could not include `[Char]`.

A single parser does not necessarily consume the entire input.
It only consumes as much input as needed to produce the target value, e.g. 
`parseString (string "abc") mempty "abcefg"` is `Success "abc"` and does not 
consume `"efg"`.

`fail` is part of the Monad typeclass but not all Monad's have an implementation
of `fail`.
Eventually, it will be moved to a MonadFail class.
