## Cycle.js: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

The Cycle.js interaction model is not specific to DOM-based applications or any
type of GUI.
Provides a general model of HCI.
Both parties listen to one another: two way cycle.

> In other words, we can say the human and the computer are mutually observed, 
> or simply having a dialogue. 

```
computer -> human
human -> computer
```

computer:

- input devices: detect actions from humans
- output devices: present information to humans

human:

- actuators: connected to the computer's input devices
- senses: connected to the computer's output devices

```
----------------      -------------
 output device | ---> | senses    |
               |      |           |
 input device  | <--- | actuators |
----------------      -------------
```

```javascript
function computer(inputDevices) {
  // define the behavior of `outputDevices`
  return outputDevices;
}
```

The human and the computer are really symmetrical functions that take the same
inputs and outputs.

```javascript
function computer(senses) {
  return actuators;
}
```

```javascript
function human(senses) {
  return actuators;
}
```

There is a circular dependency:

```
human(computer(human(// etc.)))
```

## Passive versus Proactive

In this example, `Bar` is passive because it relies on its context to change its
state:
Module Foo is proactive because it changes `Bar`'s state.

```javascript
// module Foo
import Bar from 'bar';

function onNetworkRequest() {
  Bar.incrementCounter();
}
```

Proactive (Foo) versus Passive (Bar):

```
-------       -------
| Foo |--->   | Bar |
-------       -------
```

## Listenable versus Reactive

```
-------       -------
| Foo |   --->| Bar |
-------       -------
```

Bar is reactive because it listens for an event happening in Foo and then 
updates its own state.
Foo is listenable because it emits these events.
Foo does not know what happens in response to its events.

When Bar is reactive, it is responsible for itself.
The concerns are separated.
