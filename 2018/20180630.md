# "Functional Reactive Animation" by Conal Elliot

- "Fran": a collection of datatypes and functions for creating animations
    - two primary concepts
      - Behavior: values that change over time
        - most traditional values can be modeled as a behavior
        - an animation is a behavior in the sense that an animation is an image
          that changes over time
      - Event: "sets of arbitrarily complex conditions"
    -
- distinction between modeling an animation and presenting an animation:
  - what an animation is: modeling
  - how an animation is presented: presentation
- insufficient abstraction of implementation details like:
  - moving forward in time
  - handling motion input events
  - "time slicing to update each time-varying animation parameter, even though
    these parameters conceptually vary in parallel"
- goal is to express the "what" and automate the "how"
- advantages of modeling over presentation
  - authoring
      - the end user thinks in terms of models
  - optimizability
      - model-based systems contain a presentation sub-system able to render any
        model that can be constructed within the system
      - higher level information is available to the system, so there are more
        opportunities to optimize
  - regulation
      - the presentation sub-system can regulate how much resources are consumed
        to render the model
  - mobility and safety
      - platform independence 
- Fran's modeling approach has four concepts:
  - Temporal modeling
      - behaviors: values that change over time
        - first class values
        - composable
        - implicitly concurrent
  - Event modeling
      - events: discrete conditions in the application
        - might refer to real-world events like a mouse click
        - might refer to a condition like "mouse has been clicked twice" defined
          by a predicate
        - first class values
        - events can be combined with other events to an arbitrary degree of 
          complexity
  - Declarative reactivity
      - state changes in event-based systems are often imperative
      - Fran is declarative
  - Polymorphic media
      - establishes a framework with a set of abstractions that can be applied to
        a variety of media
      - there are operations specific to each type of media, e.g. image rotation
        sound mixing, and numerical addition.
      - but these specific operations all fit within the framework of behaviors
        and events
- formal semantics
    -
