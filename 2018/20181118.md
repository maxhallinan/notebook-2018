## command line argument parsing

I was working on the CLI for a little fully connected network client.
I wanted to call the client with two arguments: the client's address and a 
comma separated list of peer addresses.
I'm using optparse-applicative for the CLI.
But optparse-applicative does not offer many combinators for parsing the 
argument values.
So I wanted to use a parser combinator library too, in this case megaparsec.
The question I had was how to use these two libraries together.
I thought this would be more complicated than it was.
I am still foggy on how these things work.
I still have a hard time reasoning about using Monads.
I was thinking that I would have to combine the optparse-applicative parser and
the megaparsec parser using a Monad transformer.
But I just needed to run the megaparsec parser on the input.
Running the parser produces a Maybe or Either, depending on which function you
use.
Then optparse-applicative has a function `maybeReader` or `eitherReader` that
creates a `ReadM`.
You pass `ReadM` to the `argument` or `option` constructors, and you get back an
optparse-applicative `Parser a`.
So it's actually straightforward.
