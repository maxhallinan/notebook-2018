"Partial function": a function that doesn't cover all possible cases.

Configure compiler to check for exhaustive pattern matching with the `Wall`
option.

Applying a typeconstraint to a typeclass:

```haskell
data Identity a = 
  Identity a

instance Eq a => Eq (Identity a) where
  (==) (Identity x) (Identity y) = x == y
```

**Questions**

1. What is `warning: [-Wtype-defaults]`?
1. Is it possible to derive a typeclass instance for any type:

```haskell
Numâ€™ is not a stock derivable class (Eq, Show, etc.)
        Try enabling DeriveAnyClass
```
