# Vim toggle between opening/closing bracket

`%`

# sed

## Delimiter

`s` is the substitution command. 
Substitute one pattern for another:

```bash
$ echo 'front' | sed 's/front/back/'
back
```

sed programs begin with a command.
The command is followed by the delimiter character.

```bash
$ echo 'front' | sed 's_front_back_'
back
```
The delimiter character is arbitrary.
`/` is used by convention.
Delimiter is intended to make things readable.

## Address

An address can be provided to specify which line of the text to edit.
If no address is provided, sed modifies every line.

```bash
$ echo 'front\nback\nfront' | sed '1s/front/back/'
back
back
front
```

**Address symbols**:

- `n`: a line number
- `$`: the last line
- `/regexp/`: Lines matching a POSIX basic regular expression
- `address,address`: a range of lines from `address1` to `address2` inclusive
- `address!`: mastch all lines except `address`
- `address,+n`: match address plus the follwing `n` lines
