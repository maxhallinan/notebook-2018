# Rank-N-Types

- [24 Days of GHC Extensions: Rank N Types](https://ocharles.org.uk/guest-posts/2014-12-18-rank-n-types.html)

Concrete values:

```haskell
one :: Int
one = 1


true :: Bool
true = True

integerId :: Int -> Int
integerId x = x
```

Concrete types:

```haskell
one :: Int
two :: Bool
integerId :: Int -> Int
```

Parametric polymorphism

```haskell
id :: a -> a
id x = x

const :: a -> b -> a
const x y = x
```

## Rank-1 Polymorphism

`id` is an identity function _for all_ types `a`.
There is an identity function for any type.

This can be expressed as:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

id :: forall a. a -> a
```

`id` is not one function but instead a "family" of functions.
When `id` is applied to a value, `a` becomes instantiated to the type of that
value.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

id :: forall a. a -> a
id x = x

one :: Int
one = id 1 -- id :: Int -> Int
```

Promise and demand.

```haskell
-- *promises* that the function `id` will work for all types `a`
id :: forall a. a -> a 
id x = x

-- *demands* that `id` works for type `Int`
one :: Int
one = id 1
```

## Rank-2 Polymorphism

## What is the domain of a function?

The domain of `y = f x` is the set of all `x` values which will output valid `y`
values.

```haskell
someInt :: (forall a. a -> a) -> Integer
someInt id' = id 1
```

## Higher-Rank Polymorphism

## Rank-N Types, The Haskell Book

Functors lift functions over structure to transform the value.

What if you want the opposite: transform the structure and not the value?

That would have this type:

```haskell
nat :: (f -> g) -> f a -> g a
```

But this type is impossible.

`f` and  `g` in `f -> g` have kind `*`.

Can express the idea like this:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

type Nat f g = forall a . f a -> g a
```

This syntax allows us to not put `a` in the type constructor `Nat f g`.

"...we shouldn’t have any specific information about the contents of 𝑓 and 𝑔 
because we’re supposed to be only performing a structural transformation, not a 
fold." - p. 676
