More thoughts about a little language related to the idea that there are 
categories of data and categories of operations on data (types, typeclasses).

Maybe this is too goal-oriented. 
It's not open-ended enough.

```
Here is a `Duck`.
We want to turn a `Duck` into a `Horse`.
But we don't have a spell for that.
What can we do?
We have a spell that can transform a `Duck` into a `Cow`.
And we have a spell that can transform a `Cow` into a `Horse`.
So first we can cast `Duck` to `Cow` and then `Cow` to `Horse`.
```
