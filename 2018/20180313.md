```sql
CREATE TABLE foo 
( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
);
```

`AND` operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar > 50 AND baz < 100;
```

`OR` operator

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=50 OR baz=100;
```

`AND` has precedence over `OR`. 
Parentheses can be used to give higher precedence to or:

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo where bar=10 AND (baz=20 OR qux=12)
```
