## `IN` and `NOT IN`

This query can be simplified using the `IN` or `NOT IN` operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar = "x" OR bar = "y" OR bar = "z";
```

`IN` operator

```sql
/* all rows where the bar column has a value of "x", "y", and "z" */
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar IN ("x", "y", "z")
```

`NOT IN`

```sql
/* all rows where the bar column does not have a value of "x", "y", and "z" */
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar NOT IN ("x", "y", "z")
```

## Subqueries

Select all rows in `table_` where the value of the `foo` column matches the 
value of the `bar` column in `table_2`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_1 WHERE foo in (SELECT bar FROM table_2);
```

## Inexact matches

`LIKE`

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_1 WHERE foo LIKE "%bar%"
```

Matches any row where `foo` contains the substring `"%bar%"`.

## Restricting grouped results with HAVING

`SUM`: aggregate the sum of a column.

Add up the calories burnt for each type of exercise:

```sql
SELECT x, SUM(y) FROM table_1 GROUP BY x;
```

`AS`: rename a column.

```sql
SELECT x, SUM(y) AS total_y FROM table_1 GROUP BY x;
```

`HAVING`: filter an aggregate to a value.

```sql
SELECT x, SUM(y) AS total_y FROM table_1 GROUP BY x HAVING total_y > 10;
```

## `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`

`WHERE`: a condition on individual rows.
`HAVING`: a condition on aggregations, e.g. count, average, min, max, sum

## Calculating results with `CASE`

Use a `CASE` operator to map column values to other values:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*),
  CASE
    WHEN foo = "x" THEN "X"
    WHEN foo = "y" THEN "Y"
    WHEN foo = "z" THEN "Z"
    ELSE "?"
  END as "col_name"
FROM table_1 
GROUP BY col_name;
```
