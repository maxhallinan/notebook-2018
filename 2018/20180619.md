Problem:

Default backend not redirecting http -> https.

Causes:

Problem:

`A connection cannot be made with ws://generics.maxhallinan.com/travel`.

Causes:

My nginx-ingress controller was an AWS Elastic Load Balancer:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/service-l7.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/patch-configmap-l7.yaml
```

ELB _does_ support TLS termination but does _not_ support websockets.

I can access the websockets server by using an AWS Network Load Balancer: 

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/service-l4.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/patch-configmap-l4.yaml
```

NLB _does_ support websockets but does _not_ support TLS termination.

[This]https://medium.com/ww-engineering/k8s-ws-aws-elb-nlb-5a23834d4f14) blog
post has some ideas about how to work around that problem.
