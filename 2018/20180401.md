- I learn best when I know the usefullness of what I'm learning.
- I learn best by applying what I've learned.

Why does a compose function take `f -> g -> x -> f (g x)`?
Why is the last function called the first argument, and not the first function
called the first argument?

What is the meaning of "over" in "functor over number"?

## Functors 

### Identity

Mapping `id` over the functor is the same as calling `id` on the functor.

```haskell
fmap id (Just 3) == id (Just 3)
```

### Composition

```haskell
fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g
fmap (f . g) F == fmap f (fmap g F)
```

## Applicative Functors

How would you filter all `Nothing`'s from a `[Maybe]`?
