One thing I find weird about basic `Dockerfile` examples is how they bake in
the port that's exposed on the container.
This would seem to make the image less portable.
What if the container exposed port 3000 but a process is already listening on
the same port?
This isn't a problem because container ports can be mapped to host ports.
If container A and container B both expose port 3000, A can be mapped to 3001 
and B can be mapped to 3002.

The weirdness starts within the container. 
If the container exposes port `3000`, then the application running inside the 
container _must_ listen on port `3000`.
The application will be unreachable if it's listening on port `3001`.
For this reason, it might seem prudent to hardcode the application port into the
application code.
But then I've coupled the application code to the Docker environment.

What I really want is a single place to configure the port exposed by the
container and the port the application listens on.
Then the two will never be out of sync.
Here is a way to do that:

1. Remove the `EXPOSE` directive from the Dockerfile.
1. Create a `.env` file.
1. Set a `APP_PORT` environmental variable the `.env` file.
1. In the application code, reference `APP_PORT` when starting the server. For
example:

```javascript
app.listen(process.env.APP_PORT);
```

1. Run the container with this command:

```bash
source .env

docker run \
  --env-file .env \
  --expose $MY_APP_PORT \
  --publish <host port>:$MY_APP_PORT
  <image name>
```

Then `.env` file becomes the single point of configuration for all places where 
the port number should be identical.
