## The Haskell Book, Chapter 9.8 "Spines and nonstrict evaluation"

A list is a "cons cell" of a value and another list.

```
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
```

The cons cell is the `a : [a]`.

The cons cells for the list `[1, 2, 3]` are often represented like:

```
1 : 2 : 3 : []
```

Lists, sequences, trees, and some other data structures have "spines".

The spine is what holds the data together in the collection.

The cons operator is the spine of the list. 

Some operations on lists do not require the values in the list to be evaluated.

This is possible because:

- spine
- nonstrict evaluation

Evaluating a list proceeds _down_ the spine.

Constructing a list proceeds _up_ the spine.

Spines are evaluated independent of values.

For example, you can find the length of a list without evaluating the values in
the list.

### Weak head normal form

By default, Haskell evaluates values to "weak head normal form" (WHNF).

WHNF evaluates the expression only far enough to reduce it to a data constructor.

"Normal form" is the fullest evaluation of a value.

All values in normal form are also in weak head normal form.

```haskell
-- WHNF and NF
(1, 2)

-- WHNF 
(1, 1 + 2)
(1, "foo" ++ "bar")

-- WHNF and NF
\x -> x + 10

-- not WHNF or NF
"foo" ++ "bar"

-- WHNF, not NF
[1..10]
```

A list that is in WHNF is one where the cons cells have been constructed but not
the concrete values within the cells.
