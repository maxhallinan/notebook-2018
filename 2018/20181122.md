## Progress on low-level networking in Haskell

TCP server keeps running by looping.
The looping is implemented by recursion.
The flow is
1. Create a socket.
1. Bind that socket to a given port.
1. Here is where the recursion starts: listen for connections on that socket.
1. Fork the main thread for each new connection. Otherwise the first connection
   blocks the main loop that is listening for more connections.
1. The connection comes in the form of a second second.
1. Use this socket to send or receive messages through the connection.
1. Listening for messages is its own loop: `NetByte.recv` will receive one 
   message, then the function will return.
   To receive messages continually, you have to call the function recursively.

## Questions

- When I disconnect a client, the server starts logging a bunch of new messages
  from that client. All of the messages are empty. So there must be some clean
  up that I have to do after a connection closes. How do I do that cleanup?
- I'm just naively printing new messages to the terminal. Are there any problems
  with this? Real World Haskell uses this MVar to lock. Do I need to do this?
