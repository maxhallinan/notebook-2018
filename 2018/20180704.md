## d3 and React

- [Interactive Applications with React and D3](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/interactive-applications-with-react-d3-f76f7b3ebc71)
  - use d3 for algorithim stuff
  - use React to render SVG
- [Data vizualization with Cycle.js](https://github.com/jvanbruegge/adcs_plot)

Questions

- what browsers are we supporting?
- what features do we need?
- what are the chart types?
- should we use d3.js or something with more abstractions?
- should we use javascript or elm?
- what grid should we use?
