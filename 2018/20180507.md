# Haskell from First Principles: Chapter 9

`List` is a sum type because it is either an empty list _or_ a single value and 
a non-empty list:

```haskell
-- definition of List
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
```

`:` is a product type because it joins two arguments.
`:` is called cons which is short for "constructor".

Pattern matching on a list

```haskell
head :: [a] -> Maybe a
head [] = Nothing
head (x : _) = Just x

tail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
tail [] = Nothing
tail (_ : xs) = Just xs
```

These work because `:` is a data constructor and like all data constructors, it
can be pattern matched.

**list terminology**

- _cons cell_: the conceptual space a value inhabits. `a : [a]` is a cons cell.
- _spine_: the structure that holds the cons cells together.
