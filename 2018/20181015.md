## Haskell `forall`

3 common uses for this keyword.
Each use requires a different language extensions:

- `ScopedTypeVariables`
- `RankNTypes/Rank2Types`
- `ExistentialQuantification`

Example function 

```haskell
foo :: forall a b . (b -> b) -> b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
foo postProcess onNothing onJust mX =
  postProcess x
  where 
    x :: b
    val = maybe onNothing onJust mX
```

### Scoped type variables

This enables the `b` type variable in the `where` clause the same `b` in the 
type signature for `foo`.

### Rank-N-Types

These two types are equivalent when ScopedTypeVariables *is not enabled*.

```haskell
mayb :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
```

```haskell
mayb :: forall a b. b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
```

These type signatures indicate that they work for any type `a` and any type `b`.

What is the type of `liftTup` in this example:

```haskell
putInList x = [x]
liftTup putInList (1, "Foo")
-- ([1], ["Foo"])
```

The type is:

```haskell
liftTup :: (forall x. x -> f x) -> (a, b) -> (f a, f b)
```

To demonstrate:

```
ghci> let liftTup f (x, y) = (f x, f y)
ghci> liftTup (\x -> [x]) (1, "Foo")
 No instance for (Num [Char]) arising from the literal ‘1’
```

The above doesn't work, even thought it should.
We can try adding a type signature to `liftTup`.

```haskell
liftTup :: (x -> f x) -> (a, b) -> (f a, f b)
liftTup f (x, y) = (f x , f y)
-- Couldnt match expected type 'x' against inferred type 'b'
```

But that doesn't work either.

Have to use the `forall` keyword to indicate that the function `(x -> f x)` 
should work for any possible value of `x`, including values of type `a` or `b`.

```haskell
liftTup :: (forall x. x -> f x) -> (a, b) -> (f a, f b)
```
