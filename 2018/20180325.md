# 25 March 2018

An `IO` action is performed when it is given a name of `main` and the program is
run.

`do` composes one or more `IO` actions.

`<-` is used to expose the result of an `IO` action.

```haskell
main = do
  putStrLn "What is your name?"
  name <- getLine 
  putStrLn $ "Nice to meet you, " ++ name
```

`main` always has a type of `IO a`, where `a` is a concrete type.

An `IO` action is only performed when it is composed within the `main` `IO` action.

## `let` in a `do` block

```haskell
import Data.Char

main = do
  putStrLn "What's your first name?" 
  firstName <- getLine
  putStrLn "What's your last name?"
  lastName <- getLine
  let fName = map toUpper firstName
      lName = map toUpper lastName
  putStrLn $ "Hi," ++ fName ++ lName ++ "!"
```

## continuous execution

This program gets a line from the terminal, reverses that line, and prints it 
back to the terminal.
If the line is blank, the program exits.

```haskell
main = do
  line <- getLine
  if null line
    then return ()
    else do
      putStrLn $ reverseWords line
      main

reverseWords :: String -> String
reverseWords = unwords . map reverse . words
```

## `return` 

`return` is used to lift a value into an `IO` action.
`return` does not exit the execution context like a function return from an 
imperative language like Python.
`return ()` creates an `IO` of an empty tuple.
`return "Foo"` creates an `IO` of the string `"Foo"`.

```haskell
main = do
  x <- return "foo"
  y <- return "bar"
  z <- return "baz"
  -- "foobarbaz"
  putStrLin $ x ++ y ++ z
```

- `putStr`: prints a string to standard output
- `putStrLn`: prints a string to standard output, appends a new line
- `putChar`: prints a character to standard output.
- `print`: takes any instance of `Show`, stringifies it, and prints the result to
standard output.
- `getChar`: takes the next character from standard input.

## conditional branching in a do block

Conditional branching can be done with an if/else statement inside a do block.

```haskell
main = do
  c <- getChar
  if c \= ' ' then
    do 
      putChar c
      main
  else
    do
      return ()
```

The conditional can be encapsulated using `where` from `Control.Monad`.

```haskell
import Control.Monad as Control

main = do
  c <- getChar
  when (c \= ' ') $ do
    putChar c
    main
```

`where` will return `IO ()` when the condition is false.

## Sequencing IO actions

IO actions are performed in the order they are placed in the `do` block.

```haskell
main = do
  a <- getLine
  b <- getLine
  c <- getLine
  print [a,b,c]
```

The above can be simplified with `sequence`.
`sequence` takes a list of IO actions and returns a list of their results.

```haskell
main = do
  rs <- sequence [getLine, getLine, getLine]
  print rs
```

This won't compile because it has type `[IO ()]` and the expected type is `IO ()`.

```haskell
main =
  map print [1,2,3]
```

To make this compile, first map and then sequence:

```haskell
main =
  sequence $ map print [1,2,3]
```

This results in a single IO action that performs a list of IO actions.

## `mapM` and `mapM_`

Composing map and sequence is so common that it has been abstracted to `mapM` and
`mapM_`.

`mapM`: maps over a list and then sequences the list and returns the result.
`mapM_`: does the same thing as `mapM` but throws away the result.

## Various other control functions

`forever` takes an `IO` action and repeats that action continuously, without 
stopping.

`forM` is the same as `mapM` except the parameters are reversed.


## getContents

Instead of using `getLine` recursively, use `getContent` to read from standard
input.
`getContent` reads from the input buffer lazily and does not store the entire 
input in memory at the same time.


`interact`: takes a function `String -> String`, calls it with standard input
and returns the result to standard output.

## File I/O

```haskell
openFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle
data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode
```

```haskell
import System.IO

main do
  -- create a read-only handle on the file "foo.txt"
  handle <- openFile "foo.txt" ReadMode
  -- get the contents of the file from the handle
  -- hGetContents :: Handle -> IO String
  -- lazily reads the file
  contents <- hGetContents handle
  -- print the contents of the file to standard output
  putStr contents
  -- hClose :: hClose -> IO ?
  -- closes the file
  hClose handle
```

A handle is essentially a reference to the file?

The above involves manually opening and closing the file.
`withFile` encapsulates this process.

```haskell
import System.IO

main = do
  withFile "foo.txt" ReadMode (\handle -> do
    contents <- hGetContents handle
    putStr contents)
```

There are similiar file handles for 
Like standard input/output, there are these helper functions for file handles: 
`hGetLine`, `hPutStr`, `hPutStrLn`, `hGetChar`


It is possible to abstract the file I/O process more with `readFile`, `writeFile`, etc.

```haskell
import System.IO

main = do
  contents <- readFile "foo.txt"
  putStr contents
```

```haskell
-- !! gets the item at the given index
-- here, foo == 1
foo = [0,1,2] !! 1
```

## randomness

All functions in Haskell are pure.
Because they are pure, all functions in Haskell must be referentially 
transparent.
A referentially transparent function returns the same value every time it is 
called with the same arguments.
A function that returns a random number cannot be referentially transparent.

```haskell
-- System.Random.random
random :: RandomGen a, Random b => a -> (b, a)
```

```haskell
-- given the same random generator, random will generate the same random number
random (mkStdGen 100) :: (Int, StdGen)
-- (-1352021624,651872571 1655838864)
random (mkStdGen 100) :: (Int, StdGen)
-- (-1352021624,651872571 1655838864)
```
The type annotation can be used to create different types of random values.

```haskell
random (mkStdGen 100) :: (Float, StdGen)
-- (0.8938442,1597344447 1655838864)
random (mkStdGen 100) :: (Bool, StdGen)
-- (False,1485632275 40692)
random (mkStdGen 100) :: (Integer, StdGen)
-- (1691547873,1597344447 1655838864)
```

`random` returns a new random generator so that it is easy to create a sequence 
of random values:

```haskell
threeRandom :: StdGen -> (Integer, Integer, Integer)
threeRandom gen =
  let (one, gen') = random gen
      (two, gen'') = random gen'
      (three, gen''') = random gen'''
  in
  (one, two, three)
```

`randoms` can be used to create an infinite list of random values.

```haskell
-- get the first five in a list of random integers
take 5 $ randoms (mkStdGen 100) :: [Int]
```

`randoms` does not return a random generator because it is implemented as an 
infinitely recursive function:

```haskell
randoms' :: (RandomGen g, Random a) => g -> [a]
randoms' gen = let (value, newGen) = random gen in value:randoms' newGen
```

## random numbers within a range

`randomR` is generate a random number within a range:

```haskell
-- randomR :: StdGen a, Random b => (b,b) -> a -> (b, a)
randomR (1,6) (mkStdGen 1) :: Int
```

To generate random characters:

```haskell
take 5 $ randomRs ('a','z') (mkStdGen 1) :: [Char]
['h','h','d','z','d']
```

## create a random random generator

If you use `mkStdGen`, then your program will always generate the same random 
numbers, unless the seed is random input.

To create a new random number each time the program is run without providing 
random input to use as a seed, use the `getStdGen` IO action:

```haskell
import System.Random

-- generate 20 random characters
main = do
  gen <- getStdGen
  putStr $ take 20 (randomRs ('a','z') gen)
```

To get two standard random generators, use `newStdGen`.

```haskell
import System.Random
main = do
  gen1 <- getStdGen
  putStrLn $ take 2 (randomRs ('a','z') gen1)
  gen2 <- getStdGen
  putStrLn $ take 2 (randomRs ('a','z') gen2)
```

The above will print the same random characters on both lines.
That's because `getStdGen` returns the same generator every time it is called
(referentially transparent).

Use `newStdGen` to create a new standard generator after calling `getStdGen`.

```haskell
import System.Random

main = do
  gen1 <- getStdGen
  putStrLn $ take 2 (randomRs ('a','z') gen1)
  gen2 <- newStdGen
  putStrLn $ take 2 (randomRs ('a','z') gen2)
```

The two lines will contain different random characters.

After calling `newStdGen`, the result of `getStdGen` will be different:

```haskell
main = do
  gen1 <- getStdGen
  newStdGen
  gen2 <- getStdGen
```

## Bytestrings

Strings are list of characters.
Characters don't have a fixed size.
It takes several bytes to represent a character.
Lists are also lazy - the items in a list don't exist until the are accessed.
For these reasons, processing a file as a string is not efficient.

Bytestrings are like lists except that every element is a byte.
There are lazy and not-lazy (strict) bytestrings.
