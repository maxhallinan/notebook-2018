# Kinds in Haskell

[Learn You a Haskell: Kinds and some type-foo](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#the-functor-typeclass)

Like functions, type constructors can have parameters: `Maybe a`.
A type can be applied to a type constructor with a parameter: `Maybe String`.
A concrete type is the result of applying a type to a type constructor:

```haskell
-- abstract type
Maybe a
-- concrete type
Maybe String

-- abstract type
Map k v
-- concrete type
Map String Int
```

Type constructors are curried, so they can be partially applied.

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

class Functor f of
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor (Either a) of
  fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)
  fmap f (Left x) = Left x
```

Types describe categories of values.
Kinds describe categories of types.

`*` is a concrete type.

```
ghci> :k Int
*

ghci> :k Maybe String
*
```

`* -> *` is a type constructor.
This type constructor takes one concrete type and returns a second concrete 
type.

```
ghci> :k Maybe
* -> *

ghci> :k Either
* -> * -> *

ghci> import Data.Map
ghci> :k Map
* -> * -> *
```

The `Functor` typeclass expects a type of kind `* -> *`.
`Either` is a type of kind `* -> * -> *`.
To make `Either` a functor, the `Either` constructor had to be partially 
applied.

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

class Functor f of
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor (Either a) of
  fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)
  fmap f (Left x) = Left x
```

## type foo


```haskell
class Foo t where
  foo :: j a -> t a j
```

Kinds:

- `j` =  `* -> *`
- `a` = `a`
- `t` = `* -> (* -> *) -> *`

```haskell
data Bar a b = Bar (b a) deriving (Show)
```

```
ghci> data Bar a b = Bar (b a) deriving (Show)
ghci> :k Bar
Bar :: * -> (* -> *) -> *
```

```
instance Foo Bar where
  foo x = Bar x
```
