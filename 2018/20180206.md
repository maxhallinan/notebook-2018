## Deploying a Jekyll website to the Dat network

- Use a separate Jekyll configuration for the Dat version of the site.
  All paths should be relative in the Dat version.
- Build site locally.
- Host Dat archive remotely.
- SSH into remote host.
- Remove all contents of Dat archive except `.dat`.
- Rsync or scp contents of local build to remote Dat archive.
- `dat share` to commit updates.

### Questions

- Why build locally? Is there any reason to build locally? Why not build 
  remotely?
- Could trigger the build remotely. Run a build script remotely.
- What's the difference between rsync and scp? Is one clearly better for this?
- Is there a way to rsync and then delete any files in the target directory that
  aren't in the source (except `.dat`)?
- Should I compress the files before transferring them to the remote host?
- Problem: running `dat share` in the background so I can seed the archive. I 
  update the site wtih rsync. Each time rsync writes to the directory, dat 
  automatically bumps the version. This means that deploying a website leads to 
  many version bumps (~300 for my website) during one deploy. Is there a way to 
  do all updates and then commit them without stopping/starting `dat share`? 
  Maybe `dat sync` is what I should run in the background and `dat share` is what
  I should run after each deploy.
