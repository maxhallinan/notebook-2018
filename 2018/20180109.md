## `tr`

`tr` ("translate") replaces one set of characters with the corresponding 
character from a second set.
In `tr 'abc' 'ABC'`, all `a` is replaced by `A`, `b` by `B`, and `c` by `C`.

## `sort` field definitions

`sort` divides a line into fields separated by blank space.
`Foo bar baz` has three fields.
The `-k` argument is used to define a custom field. 
The format for a field definition is `START[CHAR][OPTS],END[CHAR][OPTS]`.
`OPTS` override the global ordering options just for that key.
If no key is given, the entire line is used as the key.

## Bash ANSI-C Quoting

From the [Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ANSI_002dC-Quoting.html):

`$'string'` replaces backslashed escpaed characters with the real thing.
`$'\t'` expands to a tab in single quotes.
The expanded result is always single-quoted.
