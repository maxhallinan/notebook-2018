## Applicative versus Monad

When you have three computations and none of those computations are 
interdependent, then use an Applicative operation.

```haskell
-- This is better written as an Applicative
doSomething = do
  x <- f
  y <- g
  z <- h
  pure (x, y, z)

-- re-written as an Applicative
liftA3 (\x y z -> (x, y, z)) f g h
```

When you have three dependent computations, then use Monad operations.

```haskell
-- This is a good use for a Monad
doSomething' = do
  x <- f
  y <- g x
  z <- h y
  pure (x, y, z)
```

## AccValidation

[AccValidation documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Validation-0.2.0/docs/Data-Validation.html)

The Data.Validation library is like Data.Either but makes the concepts of 
failure and success explicit.

```haskell
data Validation error a = Failure error | Success a
```

`AccValidation` can represent more than one error.
It "accumulates" the errors.

```haskell
data AccValidation error a = AccFailure err | AccSucccess a
```

Differences between `Validation` and `AccValidation`:

- `AccValidation` does not have a Monad instance
- `Validation` is isomorphic to Either

### Why `AccValidation` doesn't have a Monad instance

```haskell
data AccValidation error a = AccFailure error | AccSuccess a

instance Functor (AccValidation error) where
  -- fmap :: Functor f => f a -> (a -> b) -> f b
  fmap _ (AccFailure error) = AccFailure error
  fmap f (AccSuccess x)     = AccSuccess $ f x

instance Semigroup error => Apply (AccValidation error) where
  (<.>) (AccFailure error1) (AccFailure error2) = AccFailure $ error1 <> error2
  (<.>) (AccSuccess f) (AccSuccess x)           = AccSuccess $ f x
  (<.>) (AccFailure error) _                    = AccFailure error
  (<.>) _ (AccFailure error)                    = AccFailure error

instance Applicative (AccValidation error) where
  pure = AccSuccess
  -- (<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  (<*>) (AccSuccess f) (AccSuccess x) = AccSuccess $ f x
  (<*>) (AccFailure f) (AccSuccess x) = AccSuccess $ f x

instance Monad (AccValidation error) where
  return = pure
  -- (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  (>>=) (AccFailure error) f = AccFailure error
  (>>=) (AccSuccess x) f     = f x
```

`AccValidation` does not have a Monad instance because you don't want to depend
on a previous value.
Monads short-circuit the computation chain. 
When a `Nothing` is produced by bind, then you don't run the downstream 
computations.
With `AccValidation`, you can't have dependent computations that can short 
circuit because you want to accumulate as many errors as possible.

### Alternative

Alternative is a "monoid of applicative functors".

```haskell
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
  -- minimal definition
  empty :: f a
  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a     
  -- also includes
  -- one or more
  some :: f a -> f [a]
  -- zero or more
  many :: f a -> f [a]
```

Alternative is a useful typeclass for parsers:

```haskell
import Text.Trifecta

parseString (many integer) mempty "123blah789"
-- Success [123,789]

parseString (many integer) mempty "blah"
-- Success []

parseString (some integer) mempty "123blah789"
-- Success [123,789]

parseString (some integer) mempty "blah"
-- Failure (ErrInfo {_errDoc = (interactive):1:1: error: expected: integer
-- blah<EOF>
--          , _errDeltas = [Columns 0 0]})
```

## Miscellaneous parser stuff

```haskell
parseInteger :: Parser Integer
parseInteger = skipMany (oneOf "\n") >> integer
```
