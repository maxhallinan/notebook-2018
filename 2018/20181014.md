## Testing typeclass instances

checkers provides ready-made a `TestBatch` for standard algebraic typeclasses.
It can be useful and interesting to write tests for each law by hand.
To do that, write a prop function and then pass the prop function to 
`Test.QuickCheck.quickCheck`.

```haskell
import qualified Test.QuickCheck as QuickCheck

prop_semigroupAssoc :: (Eq a, Semigroup a) => a -> a -> a -> Bool
prop_semigroupAssoc x y z = 
  (x <> y) <> z == x <> (y <> z)

runTests :: IO ()
runTests = do
  -- must assert concrete types for the property function
  -- then QuickCheck will generate random values of those types
  QuickCheck.quickCheck (prop_semigroupAssoc :: String -> String -> String -> Bool)  
```
