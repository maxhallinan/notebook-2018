Frustrations

- Overcomplicated code
- Overuse/over-reliance on tools
- Code filled with things that are unnecessary
- The need to "use the full power" of something or "take full advantage" of 
  something, when there is no problem to be solved by doing something.
- Clogged code
- Using different tools, different libraries every project
- New things all the time
- Every project I work on uses a new tool that is only half-understood by the 
  person who used it, and instead of using it long enough to understand it, they
  switch to something new for the next project.
- working on other people's stuff and never having the opportunity to do my own
  stuff
