Idea: a FizzBuzz language.
The only type in the language is `FizzBuzz`, which is union of `Fizz | Buzz`.
Provide the program with a stream of input.
All input is coerced to a `Fizz`, `Buzz`, or a `FizzBuzz`.
You can then do set operations on these values.

```
Int -> FizzBuzz
main =
  case next() of
    % 3 ->
      print Fizz

    % 5 Buzz ->
      print Buzz

    % 15 ->
      print Fizz + Buzz
```
