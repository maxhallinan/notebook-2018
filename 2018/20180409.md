Idea: a FizzBuzz language.
The only type in the language is `FizzBuzz`, which is union of `Fizz | Buzz`.
Provide the program with a stream of input.
All input is coerced to a `Fizz`, `Buzz`, or a `FizzBuzz`.
You can then do set operations on these values.

```
Int -> FizzBuzz
main =
  case next() of
    % 3 ->
      print Fizz

    % 5 Buzz ->
      print Buzz

    % 15 ->
      print Fizz + Buzz
```

## ActivityStream

"Activity" is a semantic description of an action.

An ActivityStream is:

- metadata about activities
- JSON-based
- machine-readable
- human-friendly

### Minimal activity

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "summary": "User created an image",
  "type": "Create",
  "actor": "https://foo.net/user",
  "object": "https://foo.net/image.jpg"
}
```

#### `@context`

> ...identifies the context within which the object exists or the activity was
> performed.
> &mdash; [1](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-context)

The function of `@context` is to group objects and activities that share a
common originating context or purpose.

At a minimum, the `@context` of an Activity Streams 2.0 document must include
a reference to the "Activity Streams 2.0 JSON-LD @context definition" using the
URL "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams".

This is called the "normative" context.

Forms of `@context`:

String

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"
}
```

Object

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "ext": "https://example.com/terms/",
    "@language": "en"
  }
}
```

Array

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "css": "http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#styledBy"
    }
  ],
  "css": "http://www.csszengarden.com/217/217.css?v=8may2013"
}
```

In this example, `@context.css` shows where to get a semantic definition for the
`css` property.
It aliases `styledBy` to `css`.
