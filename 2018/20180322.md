## Table joins

```
table_1

col_1 | col_2
-------------
1     | foo
2     | bar
```

```
table_2

col_3 | col_4
-------------
1     | baz
2     | qux
```

### cross join

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_1, table_2
```

For every row in `table_1`, creates a copy of every row in `table_2`.

```
col_1 | col_2 | col_3 | col_4
-----------------------------
1     | foo   | 1     | baz
1     | foo   | 2     | qux
2     | bar   | 1     | baz
2     | bar   | 2     | qux
```

### inner join

```sql
/* implicit inner join */
SELECT * FROM table_1, table_2 WHERE table_1.col_1 = table_2.col_2;
/* explicit inner join */
SELECT * FROM table_1 
  JOIN table_2 
  ON table_1.col_1 = table_2.col_2;
```

For every row in `table_1`, creates a copy of every row in `table_2`.

```
col_1 | col_2 | col_3 | col_4
-----------------------------
1     | foo   | 1     | baz
2     | bar   | 2     | qux
```

### left outer join

A left outer join selects _all_ rows from the left table, even those that do not
have a relation in the right table.

```
table_1

col_1 | col_2
-------------
1     | foo
2     | bar
3     | baz
```

```
table_2

col_3 | col_4
-------------
1     | baz
2     | qux
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table_2 WHERE table_1.col_1 = table_2.col_2;
```

```
col_1 | col_2 | col_3 | col_4
-----------------------------
1     | foo   | 1     | baz
2     | bar   | 2     | qux
3     | baz   | null  | null
```

### right outer join

Does the opposite of left outer join - keeps rows in the right table that does
not have a relationship to the left table.

### full outer join

All rows, with null values in non-matching columns.

### Joining tables to themselves

A self-join is useful when a table row contains a relation to another row in 
that table.
For example, an `employees` table might include a `boss` column.
The `boss` column is the id of another employee.
To see the employee information for both the employee and the employee's boss,
join the `employees` table to itself.

```
employees

id | name | email | boss_id
---------------------------
1 | foo   | foo@work.com | 4
2 | bar   | bar@work.com | 1
3 | baz   | baz@work.com | 3
4 | qux   | qux@work.com | null
```

```sql
SELECT 
  employees.name AS employee_name, 
  bosses.name AS boss_name 
FROM employees
/* alias the employees table to "bosses" */
JOIN employees bosses
ON employees.boss_id = bosses.id;
```

### Combining multiple joins

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_1
  JOIN table_2
  ON table_1.col_1 = table_2.col_1
  JOIN table_3
  ON table_1.col_2 = table_3.col_1;
```
